# My Reads

- This is a bookshelf app that allows you select and categorize books into read, currently reading, or want to read.

- Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

- There is a search page with a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.

- This is the first project of Udacity's React Nanodegree program
